# Installation of Java + Netbeans
This guide is for Programming Classes at Wright State University.  This guide will install the software setup currently installed in CSE labs.  Once newer versions have been tested, this guide will be updated.

JDK version: 8

Netbeans version: 8.2

Use [Apache Netbeans 11](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/) at your own risk.  Our labs installs use Netbeans 8.2, not 11

For all versions, download the installer from here:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html
This installer is a lovely bundle that includes: Netbeans 8.2 AND JDK 8 (and the JRE)

## For Windows
- [Download the installer for Windows](http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk-nb/8u111-8.2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-x64.exe).  Note: this is the 64 bit installer.  
- Find the installer (usually your Downloads folder)
- Double-click the installer file to run the installer.
- At the Welcome page of the installation wizard, click Next.
- At the JDK Installation page, specify which directory to install the JDK into and click Next.
  - Make note of where this is just in case you need to set environmental varibles
  - Default is Program Files or Program Files x86
- At the NetBeans IDE Installation page, do the following:
- Specify the directory for the NetBeans IDE installation.
- Accept the default JDK installation to use with the IDE.
- Click Next.
- Review the Summary page to ensure the software installation locations are correct.
- Click Install to begin the installation.
- At the Setup Complete page, provide anonymous usage data if desired, and click Finish.

### Environment Variables
If you opened Netbeans and things look normal, you're good to go, ignore this section.  If Netbeans won't open or it's acting "wrong", you get to experience setting environment variables.

## For Mac / Apple

For NetBeans 8.2, jdk 12 is not compatible, so you need to install jdk 8
To set an environment variable, follow this guide:

You will still need to edit the netbeans.conf file, as can be found in this guide:
