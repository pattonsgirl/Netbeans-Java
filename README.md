# Installation of Java + Netbeans
This guide is for Programming Classes at Wright State University.  This guide will install the software setup currently installed in CSE labs.  Once newer versions have been tested, this guide will be updated.

JDK version: 8
Netbeans version: 8.2

Use [Apache Netbeans 11](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/) at your own risk.  Our labs installs use Netbeans 8.2, not 11

For all versions, download the installer from here:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html
This installer is a lovely bundle that includes: Netbeans 8.2 AND JDK 8 (and the JRE)

## For Windows
[Download the installer for Windows](http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk-nb/8u111-8.2/jdk-8u111-nb-8_2-windows-x64.exe).  Note: this is the 64 bit installer.

### Environment Variables
If you opened Netbeans and things look normal, you're good to go, ignore this section.  If Netbeans won't open or it's acting "wrong", you get to experience setting environment variables.

## For Mac / Apple

For NetBeans 8.2, jdk 12 is not compatible, so you need to install jdk 8
To set an environment variable, follow this guide:

You will still need to edit the netbeans.conf file, as can be found in this guide:
